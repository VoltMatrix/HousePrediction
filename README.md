# HousePrediction


This project uses the California Housing dataset to predict median house prices for different districts using Machine Learning. The goal is to build a regression model that can accurately estimate house prices based on features like income, location, and number of rooms.

The entire process includes:
Data downloading & loading
Data exploration & visualization
Feature engineering & preprocessing
Model training & evaluation
Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
Final performance testing with confidence intervals
